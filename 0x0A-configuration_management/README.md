## 0x0A. Configuration Management

- Automated configuration management using Puppet.Configuration management handles changes systematically to ensure that a system maintains its integrity over time. 
- Repetitive tasks can be managed using configuration management tools and such tools allow management of several servers from a central controller machine.
```
Benefits include:
 - Quick provisioning of new servers
 - Quick recovery from critical events
 - Version control for the server environment
```
### Puppet
Puppet has a master-slave architecture.  
The Puppet agent sends ```Facts``` to the Puppet Master and the Puppet Master sends a ```Catalogue``` that defines the configuration settings. The Puppet Slave sends back a ```Report``` to indicate that the settings have been implemented.  
Puppet Master and Puppet Slave communicate through a secured SSL.
