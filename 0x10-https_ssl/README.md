#### HTTP vs HTTPS
- HTTPS uses either SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security) to encrypt communications. 
- Both TLS and SSL use an asymmetric Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) whereby the ublic key and private key are used to encrypt comunications.
- The private key is strictly protected and should be securely kept on the webserver and only accessed by the owner.
  
#### SSL Certificate
- When a HTTPS connection to a webpage is requested, the website sends the SSL certificate to the browser. The certificate contains the public key to secure the session.
- The browser and website then initiate the SSL handshake. The SSL handshake involves generation of shared secrets to establish a secure connection.
- Since client information is encrypted, i.e., in the unlikely event of an interception in conneciton, the attacker would not be able to decrypt the data.
- The SSL certificate contains character strings that are keys used in decryption
- However SSL is disadvantageous due to increased cost to set up the infrastructure and decreased performance.
  
#### SSL Termination
- ChatGPT: SSL termination is the process of decrypting encrypted traffic at the termination point, using either a load balancer or a reverse proxy server.
- Once decrypted, the traffic is analyzed ofr security threats, monitored for compliance purposes and optimized for performance. The traffic is then sent to the destination server.

#### Task 0. World wide web
- Configure your domain zone so that the subdomain www points to your load-balancer IP (lb-01). Letâ€™s also add other subdomains to make our life easier, and write a Bash script that will display information about subdomains.
```
Requirements:
Add the subdomain www to your domain, point it to your lb-01 IP (your domain name might be configured with default subdomains, feel free to remove them)
Add the subdomain lb-01 to your domain, point it to your lb-01 IP
Add the subdomain web-01 to your domain, point it to your web-01 IP
Add the subdomain web-02 to your domain, point it to your web-02 IP
Your Bash script must accept 2 arguments:
     domain:
     type: string
     what: domain name to audit
     mandatory: yes
subdomain:
     type: string
     what: specific subdomain to audit
     mandatory: no
Output: The subdomain [SUB_DOMAIN] is a [RECORD_TYPE] record and points to [DESTINATION]
When only the parameter domain is provided, display information for its subdomains www, lb-01, web-01 and web-02 - in this specific order
When passing domain and subdomain parameters, display information for the specified subdomain
Ignore shellcheck case SC2086
Must use:
     awk
     at least one Bash function
You do not need to handle edge cases such as:
     Empty parameters
     Nonexistent domain names
     Nonexistent subdomains
```
